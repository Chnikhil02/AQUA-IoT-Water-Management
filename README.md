# AQUA: IoT Smart Water Supply & Utility Management

## 🚰 Introduction

This project tackles India’s critical water scarcity problem. With rising urban populations and heavy dependence on groundwater, smart water management is vital. Our IoT-based system measures real-time household water usage, generates bills automatically, and promotes conservation by reusing grey water for flushing, irrigation, and cleaning — reducing overall fresh water demand.


## 💡 How It Works
- Measures household water usage via sensor.
- Generates bills automatically.
- Treats grey water for reuse.
- Deducts reused water from bill to incentivize conservation.

## ⚙️ Technology
- Arduino with flow sensor & LCD.
- C code logic for billing.
- Small-scale grey water treatment unit.
